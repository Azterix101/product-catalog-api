# product-catalog-api
The Product Catalog API, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, manages product catalogs in a marketplace app. It allows CRUD operations on products and categories, using AWS S3 for catalog storage and AWS SQS for notifications. Designed for high traffic, it ensures quick responses without database fetches.
